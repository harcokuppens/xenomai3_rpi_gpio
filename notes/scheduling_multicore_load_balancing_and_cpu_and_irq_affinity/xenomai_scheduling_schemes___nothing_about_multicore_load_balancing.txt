posix  scheduling API
------------------------


source: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/pthread_setschedparam.html  


functions to get or set scheduling policy 

    int pthread_getschedparam(
           pthread_t thread, 
           int *restrict policy,
           struct sched_param *restrict param);
       
    int pthread_setschedparam(pthread_t thread, 
        int policy,
           const struct sched_param *param);


The policy parameter may have the value 

          SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_FIFO, or SCHED_RR. 
        



xenomai3 API
------------

 https://xenomai.org/documentation/xenomai-3/html/xeno3prm/group__cobalt__api__sched.html#ga14f50e1f5d815c90f1f4225eca5d3a8c

   standard posix api to set or get scheduling policy
   
      pthread_getschedparam()
      pthread_setschedparam()
      
    => see also linux_scheduling_schemes___nothing_about_multicore_load_balancing
    
    
   xenomai extends the standard linux scheduling policies with extended functions :
      
      pthread_getschedparam_ex()
      pthread_setschedparam_ex()
    
      => these also supports Cobalt-specific policies, 
         not available with the host Linux environment.

         The scheduling policies for cobalt are :

           SCHED_WEAK, SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_COBALT, SCHED_RR, SCHED_SPORADIC, 
           SCHED_TP, SCHED_QUOTA or SCHED_NORMAL;

      THUS: for xenomai's realtime cobalt kernel extra scheduling algorithms!!
      
      
      
alchemy API
-----------

note:  you need the POSIX api to change the scheduling algorithm
       however below documentation is to show which is the 
       default scheduling when creating a task with the alchemy API.
       (SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_OTHER)

http://www.cs.ru.nl/lab/xenomai/api3/group__alchemy__task.html


int rt_task_create 	( 	RT_TASK *  	task,
		const char *  	name,
		int  	stksize,
		int  	prio,
		int  	mode 
	) 		


This service creates a task with access to the full set of Alchemy services. 

  If prio is non-zero, the new task belongs to Xenomai's real-time FIFO scheduling class, aka SCHED_FIFO. 
  If prio is zero, the task belongs to the regular SCHED_OTHER class.



note: about prio 0 :

    src: https://xenomai.org/migrating-from-xenomai-2-x-to-3-x/#_scheduling (see below)
      prio 0 => SCHED_OTHER   (still scheduled by cobalt core  => not linux!!)
   
      SCHED_OTHER for a Xenomai-enabled thread is scheduled as SCHED_WEAK,0 by the Cobalt core.
  
      with SCHED_WEAK, Xenomai now accepts Linux real-time scheduling policies (SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR) to be weakly 
      scheduled by the Cobalt core, within a low priority scheduling class (i.e. below the Xenomai real-time classes, but still above the idle class).
  
    src: https://xenomai.org/introducing-xenomai-3/#_new_scheduling_policies (see below)
  
      it is now possible to run threads which belong to the lowest priority class Xenomai-wise and to the SCHED_FIFO 
      or SCHED_RR class in the regular kernel at the same time.
   
       => thus same scheduling setting withing both xenomai and linux !!
   
        IMPORTANT: match up lowest priority xenomai scheduling with
                   highest priority linux scheduling so we get a matching
                   bridge from on to the other :   SCHED_WEAK/SCHED_FIFO <-> linux/SCHED_FIFO
                 
                
               
                     ---------- priority lower  ---->  
               
                       cobalt              linux 
                       ------             -------
           
                      SCHED_WEAK      =>    
                        SCHED_FIFO         SCHED_FIFO
                
  
  
  
     => thus SCHED_OTHER is either SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR scheduled by the Cobalt core, within a low priority scheduling class,
        below the Xenomai real-time classes, but still above the idle class (linux schedular!)



Details about xenomai 3 scheduling
===================================  

https://xenomai.org/migrating-from-xenomai-2-x-to-3-x/#_scheduling

Scheduling
-----------

 * Cobalt implements the following POSIX.1-2001 services not present in Xenomai 2.x: sched_setscheduler(2),
   sched_getscheduler(2).

 * The SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, SCHED_SPORADIC and SCHED_TP classes now support up to 256 priority levels, instead of 99
   as previously with Xenomai 2.x. However, sched_get_priority_max(2) still returns 99. Only the Cobalt extended call
   forms (e.g. pthread_attr_setschedparam_ex(), pthread_create_ex()) recognize these additional levels.

 * The new sched_get_priority_min_ex() and sched_get_priority_max_ex() services should be used for querying the static
   priority range of Cobalt policies.

 * pthread_setschedparam(3) may cause a secondary mode switch for the caller, but will not cause any mode switch for
   the target thread unlike with Xenomai 2.x.

    This is a requirement for maintaining both the glibc and the Xenomai scheduler in sync, with respect to thread
    priorities, since the former maintains a process-local priority cache for the threads it knows about. Therefore, an
    explicit call to the the regular pthread_setschedparam(3) shall be issued upon each priority change Xenomai-wise,
    for maintaining consistency.

    In the Xenomai 2.x implementation, the thread being set a new priority would receive a SIGSHADOW signal, triggering
    a call to pthread_setschedparam(3) immediately.

Rationale

  The target Xenomai thread may hold a mutex or any resource which may only be held in primary mode, in which case
  switching to secondary mode for applying the priority change at any random location over a signal handler may create
  a pathological issue. In addition, pthread_setschedparam(3) is not async-safe, which makes the former method fragile.

Conversely, a thread which calls pthread_setschedparam(3) does know unambiguously whether the current calling context
is safe for the incurred migration.

 * A new SCHED_WEAK class is available to POSIX threads, which may be optionally turned on using the
   CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_WEAK kernel configuration switch.

 * By this feature, Xenomai now accepts Linux real-time scheduling policies (SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR) to be weakly
   scheduled by the Cobalt core, within a low priority scheduling class (i.e. below the Xenomai real-time classes, but
   still above the idle class).

 * Xenomai 2.x already had a limited form of such policy, based on scheduling SCHED_OTHER threads at the special
   SCHED_FIFO,0 priority level in the Xenomai core. SCHED_WEAK is a generalization of such policy, which provides for
   99 priority levels, to cope with the full extent of the regular Linux SCHED_FIFO/RR priority range.

    For instance, a (non real-time) Xenomai thread within the SCHED_WEAK class at priority level 20 in the Cobalt core,
    may be scheduled with policy SCHED_FIFO/RR at priority 20, by the Linux kernel. The code fragment below would set
    the scheduling parameters accordingly, assuming the Cobalt version of pthread_setschedparam(3) is invoked:

        struct sched_param param = {
               .sched_priority = -20,
        };

        pthread_setschedparam(tid, SCHED_FIFO, &param);

Switching a thread to the SCHED_WEAK class can be done by negating the priority level in the scheduling parameters sent
to the Cobalt core. For instance, SCHED_FIFO, prio=-7 would be scheduled as SCHED_WEAK, prio=7 by the Cobalt core.

SCHED_OTHER for a Xenomai-enabled thread is scheduled as SCHED_WEAK,0 by the Cobalt core. When the SCHED_WEAK support
is disabled in the kernel configuration, only SCHED_OTHER is available for weak scheduling of threads by the Cobalt
core.

 * A new SCHED_QUOTA class is available to POSIX threads, which may be optionally turned on using the
   CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA kernel configuration switch.

 * This policy enforces a limitation on the CPU consumption of threads over a globally defined period, known as the
   quota interval. This is done by pooling threads with common requirements in groups, and giving each group a share of
   the global period (see CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA_PERIOD).

    When threads have entirely consumed the quota allotted to the group they belong to, the latter is suspended as a
    whole, until the next quota interval starts. At this point, a new runtime budget is given to each group, in
    accordance with its share.
 
 * When called from primary mode, sched_yield(2) now delays the caller for a short while only in case no context switch
   happened as a result of the manual round-robin. The delay ends next time the regular Linux kernel switches tasks, or
   a kernel (virtual) tick has elapsed (TICK_NSEC), whichever comes first.

    Typically, a Xenomai thread undergoing the SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR policy with no contender at the same priority
    level would still be delayed for a while.

Rationale

  In most case, it is unwanted that sched_yield(2) does not cause any context switch, since this service is commonly
  used for implementing a poor man’s cooperative scheduling. A typical use case involves a Xenomai thread running in
  primary mode which needs to yield the CPU to another thread running in secondary mode. By waiting for a context
  switch to happen in the regular kernel, we guarantee that the manual round-robin takes place between both threads,
  despite the execution mode mismatch. By limiting the incurred delay, we prevent a regular high priority SCHED_FIFO
  thread stuck in a tight loop, from locking out the delayed Xenomai thread indefinitely.

  New scheduling policies

      SCHED_QUOTA

          The SCHED_QUOTA policy enforces a limitation on the CPU consumption of threads over a globally defined period, known
          as the quota interval. This is done by pooling threads with common requirements in groups, and giving each group a
          share of the global period.

          When threads have entirely consumed the quota allotted to the group they belong to, the latter is suspended as a
          whole, until the next quota interval starts. At this point, a new runtime budget is given to each group, in
          accordance with its share.


      SCHED_WEAK

          Members from the SCHED_WEAK class are weakly scheduled by Xenomai, only for the purpose of synchronizing with
          real-time threads from other scheduling classes. However, they cannot compete for CPU resources with real-time
          threads, and leave the primary domain upon return from Xenomai syscalls automatically.

          This policy is an extension of Xenomai’s special handling of the SCHED_OTHER policy to members of the SCHED_FIFO and
          SCHED_RR classes from a regular Linux kernel. In other words, it is now possible to run threads which belong to the
          lowest priority class Xenomai-wise and to the SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR class in the regular kernel at the same time.
